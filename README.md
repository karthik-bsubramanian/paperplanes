## Paperplanes

A modern, minimalist blogging platform built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. Paperplanes focuses on a delightful writing and reading experience with a clean UI, rich-text editing powered by Tiptap, authentication, and social features like following and saving posts.

### Features
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth via `@react-oauth/google`, session management, and protected routes
- **Rich editor**: Tiptap-based editor with images, lists, code blocks, and formatting
- **Social**: Follow users, view following feed, save posts
- **Search and discovery**: Featured and topic pages
- **Performance**: React Query for data fetching and caching, lazy routes
- **Design system**: Tailwind CSS v4 with custom theme tokens and animations
- **Data**: Supabase as backend (Auth/DB/Storage)

### Mobile behavior
On small screens, Paperplanes currently shows a friendly, branded message asking users to access the app on laptop/desktop while a mobile experience is being prepared. This is implemented via `src/components/MobileNotice.tsx` and can be customized or disabled as needed.
